    <article>
        <p>Since March 1st (2018) I have been working as Python Developer (Solution
Engineer). It was a big change in my life as I had been working as System
Engineer for almost 18 years.</p>
<p>It was not a fast change that I made the decision during a night ðŸ™ƒ. Since 2013 I
have started to code in Python.</p>
<p>I started creating my first Python tool, <a class="reference external" href="http://poweradm.org">http://poweradm.org</a>. It is a tool to
help System Engineers to deploy AIX LPARs in Power Systems, including
integrations with vCO.</p>
<p>I used this tool in my previous company and I used it to learn Python and
programming using Git and Gerrit for example.</p>
<p>When I was writing this code I also started with very small contributions to
OpenStack project to nova-powervm (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack/nova-powervm">https://github.com/openstack/nova-powervm</a>).
My problem to continue developing and learning more to code on that was related
to have the Power8 system (very expensive hardware to buy by myself).</p>
<p>During 3 years I wrote PowerAdm and followed OpenStack project. OpenStack still
been my reference to the OpenSource project and Python code best practices.
Always when I need a reference to do, I got to their repositories ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>Around 2016, I also wrote my first Python module for Storage Disk
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/PyStorage/">https://pypi.org/project/PyStorage/</a> and it was my first experience with Python
Package/module. It is a module to manage IBM and EMC (some models) Storage
Disk. It doesn't use API os pretty solution but was a good start.</p>
<p>I was writing a similar tool as PowerAdm to Storage Team at TIVIT, this tool is
STGAdm (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kairoaraujo/STGAdm">https://github.com/kairoaraujo/STGAdm</a>)</p>
<p>At that time I discover that I was having more fun writing in Python than doing
System Engineer tasks. ðŸ˜•</p>
<p>So, in May of 2016, I moved from Brazil to work in Poland as System Engineer
Specialist at IBM</p>
<p>I was not using PowerAdm anymore, it means no coding for that. I leave TIVIT
and STGAdm, I released the code to be continued for someone. I didn't have a
POWER8 machine to back to OpenStack contributions. I was not coding anymore ðŸ˜©.</p>
<p>After a while, I was missing code so much and I decided to have some project. I
tried to start a project with Brazilian friend but it was put on hold by us.</p>
<p>One day I decide to write something to help in my work at IBM. I started to work
on Security APAR Assistant. <a class="reference external" href="https://saassist.github.io">https://saassist.github.io</a>
This was nice to learn parsing, client, server in Python and I was having fun,
but I was working alone.</p>
<p>I decided that I should do something to learn to work in group/team following
strict rules of quality and so on and I decided to find some Open Source
project to contribute.</p>
<p>Why did I decide it? I was planning a move from System Engineer and be a Python
Developer and I thought that it could be a good way to learning.</p>
<p>In 2017, September I started to contribute to Ansible writing modules for
AIX/PowerVM ðŸ¤ª <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pulls?&amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3Akairoaraujo+ansible">https://github.com/pulls?&amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3Akairoaraujo+ansible</a></p>
<p>In parallel, I also distribute this AIX module collection in a git repository
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kairoaraujo/ansible-aix-support">https://github.com/kairoaraujo/ansible-aix-support</a></p>
<p>It made me feel good again!</p>
<p>As I mentioned, since 2018 March I moved internally in IBM Poland and now I
work as Python Developer as Solution Engineer for IBM Cloud Brokerage (
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/cloud-brokerage-solutions">https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/cloud-brokerage-solutions</a>) and I'm having
fun daily.ðŸ¤“</p>
<p>This year I have been studying a lot of testing and continuous integrations (CI)
to have codes more reliable.</p>
<p>If I miss System Engineering? Yes, I miss IBM Power systems. Would be a dream
if I could join something to work directly with Python + PowerSystems... but is
not easy.</p>
<p>I am thinking about to start to contribute to Python project (CPython).</p>
<p>What do I like to do? Python for infrastructure is what I like (Networking,
Storage, OS, etc), working with API, testing the code and nice CI.</p>
<p>The good news is coming.</p>
