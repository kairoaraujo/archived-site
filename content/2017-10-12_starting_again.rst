Last night I did prepare a big post to use in some service and it didn't work.
Final store? I lost everything that I wrote.

After that I decided re-create my website. I tried it in 2016 but as I moved
to another country I didn't have time to it.

So, when I have something to write we will be here.

Regarding my old posts stored on IBM DeveloperWorks and WordPress, I didn't
decide about migrate it to here. Opinions are welcomed.
