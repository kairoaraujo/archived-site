:summary: About me


My name is Kairo Araujo, 40+ years old. I was born in Brazil, married, father
of a lovely boy, and living in The Netherlands since 2018.

I love Information Technology(IT)/Open Source, and I have the pleasure to
work with IT. I have worked managing systems and solving problems since 1999.
:)

I worked many years as Unix System Administrator, specializing in AIX, POWER
Systems, and Linux.

Around 2013 I decided to start self-studying Software Engineering and Python.

In 2016, my System Administration was more focused on doing more automation,
working more in SRE/DevOps field.
In 2017 I had the opportunity to start my career transition and work as a
Software Engineer full time.

I like riding road bikes, running, beer and cooking.
