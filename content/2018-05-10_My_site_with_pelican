This post is how I use Pelican. I guess I found a good way to have it. Keep in
mind, I didn't create this way, I went to different blog posts and I decided
that way was easy to me.

First I use GitHub.io to publish my blog: https://pages.github.com

I will not cover this part, but I will cover how I structured my repository.

My repository is ``kairoaraujo.github.io``as standard for GitHub Pages.
https://github.com/kairoaraujo/kairoaraujo.github.io

First I created a branch named ``pelican``.

In ``pelican`` branch I created my ``.gitignore`` excluding some filesystem

.. code-block::

  .idea
  *.pyc
  *.log
  output
  cache
  *.pid
  venv
  .venv
  .ropeproject

The most important to me here is exclude the *output* folder. Because it is my
blog/site content itself.

Another interesting thing was create that in folder themes I did clone the
theme as a git submodule, that makes it easy to keep it updated.

From output folder I created the ``master`` branch that is published by Github
Pages.
